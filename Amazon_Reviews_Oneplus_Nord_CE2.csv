0,4.0,Good phone-could have been better !,"I've purchased the 6GB version of this phone which comes with an extendable 2 GB RAM (virtual memory) capability.Good phone, but being the least expensive category offering from One-plus, there are some small evident points that will get noticed. First thing is the confusing placement of the power button (and hence the finger sensor). Daily handling of the mobile phone feels a bit annoying with fingers locking/un-locking the phone while you try to handle it and place it into Your pockets. Although this is not a big problem, it is still something to think about. The second point is about lag here and there (only to a noticeable bit), which i am hoping might go away with updates/improvements. The third point is about the speaker volume. The speaker is good only at its near maximum levels i.e the volume does not seem to creep up steadily, rather louds out only at its top volume limits. The fourth point and final one is about the camera shoots where the colors are not very realistic. Photos taken in day light especially on skin tone tend to be over coloured.  LED flash is average and could have been better.The good and awesome part about this phone is about its practicality for daily users with one-plus strong brand part for the pricing offered. Battery life is very good and its re-charging capability is also very impressive for someone like me who has just moved from a Android 10 phone. Build of the phone is apt and will survive normal falls or mishaps from happening. The Phone does feel solid in hand. Stock android is clean and nothing to complain about.Overall a clean phone with small improvements that would make it an all-rounder and cut above the rest keeping one-plus branding in mind.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 19 December 2022
1,4.0,Nice phone in this budget,Very good phone in this budget. But last year this phone was selling 18k with no cost emi. But now I purchased almost 20k with 3 month EMI . One more thing all four corners have lineing in this phone so don't confused. It's not broken. It's design,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 3 May 2023
2,4.0,A mildly perfect phone,"I will try to keep this review short. This review is just from the perspective of an average user I believe after you buy a phone and start to use it, you change yourself to adjust with it without complaining much.There is always a better device out there in the same price but just use it, it's just a tool nothing much.Pros:1. Camera is pretty good no cons about this.2. Software is sweet and other little features from one plus make it more sweet3. There aren't any negatives about speed or power it can run 99% of the apps people use generally without any issue.4. Build quality is good as well given that you going to use some sort of case on it.Cons1.The only con I see it is the battery you need to charge it twice in most of the days. If you browse internet use camera for some time watch YouTube, Instagram, Facebook or other media apps for like an hour or two on mid brightness or more then maximum achievable screen on time is around 7-8.5 hours. But given that high speed charger, battery isn't really an issue.Do some tweaking's around the settings and delete the preinstalled apps stop unnecessary apps from the background you can easily achieve 9hr plus screen on time.Peace",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 12 January 2023

20,4.0,Nice 5G phone at a decent price,"I loved the colour (sky blue), which looked exceptional when I opened it. Just started using it so cannot comment much on the performance. My mom always used Samsung before, and is fairly comfortable with the change of brand. She is using this since couple of weeks without concerns, but could have had better features at this price. This probably can only fit 2 SIM cards or 1 SIM and 1 SD card, that was surprising. Camera quality does not look great even though the brand claims to have higher MP camera's. Both SIM slots are mentioned 5G, which is great and battery quality so far looks reasonable.",2 April 2023

54,4.0,Budget friendly reliable phone,"I bought the phone in Jan 2023 @ 18250. Below are pros and cons I observed.Pros:1. Lightweight2. Good processor (snapdragon 695) for day to day task. No heating issue.3. Display is bright enough for sunlight usage.4. Network connectivity is good. I am able to use Jio 5g on this phone. Best speed so far is 500 Mbps. Call quality is good.5. Ram management is decent and with ram plus i.e. 6+6 I don't find any lag even with heavier tasks.6. Speaker is loud, clear and good.7. Fingerprint scanner is good and faster.8. Oxygen OS is clean and snappier without any bloatwares.9. Main Camera and front camera is decent in this price range. Low-light performance is decent but you need a steady hand for shake free images. Camera comes with good features.10. Battery backup is really good. Lasts 1.5 to 2 days easily with normal to medium usage. Attached the battery usage details.Cons:1. Display is IPS LCD. Could have been Amoled.2. Missing OIS on main camera. EIS is not really helpful.3. Cannot record 4k videos.4. Plastic body is ok but not very durable.5. No gorilla glass protection. Better to install some screen protection.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 5 February 2023

First image is nokia 6.1 plus and second is one plus nord ce 2 on same day.2. The quality of Audio while listening music or capture video is not as expected, i guess nokia 6.1 plus audio is better than this mobile.3. Some time auto stopped while listening music.4. Connect to call is awesome 5/5 for this purpose.5. Calculator is awesome for researcher purpose.6. During day time heating problem while taking pictures or making video, i observe nokia 6.1 plus is all time cool, nokia has big issue- software problems, charger problems, jack problems otherwise nokia is better than Apple.7. Battery is awesome better than nokia or other mobile phone but drain very fast even not using internet connection.8. Look is awesome but bigger than hand so may be fall during call.9. one plus gave cover free of cost but there is no protection for camera.10. If you are searching data from your SD slot then it is very slow even data is only 200mb , but nokia is very fast even data is more than 128 gb.Over all this is not as expected (5/10) because data consuming more than other mobile even we never use any social media apps.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 9 April 2023

 Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos 😂 but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",26 February 2022

You have to make changes in the basic settings for it to become less technical and more usage friendly, like keypad. Battery is not draining fast but charges fast. The adapter is gigantic and travelers would need extra space for it. Adjusting to the sim tray and external memory or sim option could prove challenging. Bluetooth sound with wireless Samsung neck band wasn't so great. Sound vibrates while taking a video call. You should lower it to avoid spoiling the speakers.

333,5.0,A good choice for upgrade,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",27 February 2022

360,5.0,It's worth the money,"Well, wherever I have looked at the review of this phone, I have came across a lot of bad mouthing for sure - especially in comparison to the phones from Realme or Xiaomi.What I felt the reason for that is, the 1+ branding. People are judging this phone based on the brand image of 1+ and the expectations are pretty high. But if you consider this one from the standpoint of pure pricing, I think you'll find yourself on some reasonable ground.Reasons for me to go with this one -1) Needed good RAM and internal memory.2) Pretty good Camera performance was needed. (Stock camera app is not great, so side loaded G cam & desired result has been achieved)3) Needed clean UI. Cannot tolerate advertising and bloatwares. (Biggest reason for me to not go for Xiaomi or Realme)4) Guaranteed 2 upcoming Android updates and security updates for 3 years.5) Very good battery, with ultra fast 33W charging.Not a gamer. So didn't care for that aspect.Occasion reading will be done on the phone. Good display in that aspect. 90Hz or 120Hz doesn't personally make a difference to me. So...Call quality (clear quality & no drops, good Bluetooth TWS connections) is good.I am such a user, who do not go in to the minute details when using a phone. A phone serves these above said purposes for me. I do not care if the fingerprint reader has a 0.1 micro second delay that some other brand!! So, this one ticks all the boxes.To make my POV clear, I am someone who do not find sense in spending huge amount of money on a 6 inch phone, which you will use for YouTube and Instagram. But at the same time I am someone who will favour paying good money on productive devices like an iPad or a MacBook depending on the utility of the same. It all boils down to what you want out of the device. Do not follow the crowd. Choose as per your UTILITY.",16 December 2022

388,3.0,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone. If you're a user who wants decent performance and camera, then go for this phone.Will update my reviews ad and when I keep using this phone and find anything.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 28 February 2022

First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 8 November 2022

590,5.0,Mid ranger Flagship.,I got this mobile for ₹ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ₹3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ₹20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 27 February 2022

And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand.

 I am editing the review what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 5 months :Pros:1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)2. OS & Software: Got 3 security updates using since 5 months & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.9. You can definitely enjoy 4K YouTube Videos (As HDR 10 Certified).10. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brands neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.Cons:1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)2. Camera should be improved in low light.3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.4. You can't record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 24 September 2022

773,4.0,Good one,"*Battery life is decent, if you're a heavy user you'll get a backup of 12-15hrs after 100% charge.But as I'm not a heavy user I'm getting a backup of more than 24 hrs.*Camera is also good, night mode is working good if you have a good light, if not you'll not get satisfaction.*The main issue of this phone is brightness. If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness. But rest all are working fine.",2 November 2022

You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",7 July 2022

Company taken the exact copy of realme 9 pro infact cutting some features like wide angle.4. In the name of 33 watt fast charging it's too slow and equivalent to 18 watt vivo charging as I tested in my 4 years old Vivo z1x5. Side mounted fingerprint works average and sometimes may trouble you .6.Battery life is less than 20 hours in light usage.So I will honestly suggest you don't go for such brand name and choose a better option in vivo oppo and realme phones .Infact OnePlus Nord ce3 lite is not worth going .,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 April 2023

 To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",16 September 2022

986,5.0,A Pragmatic User's Take,"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts.",22 September 2022
987,4.0,Practical phone,"Review after 10 days.It's a very good and practical phone if you are able to purchase it under 20k by applying coupons and exchange.Build : I like metal build but Ok with the plastic and Glass builds as well. This is very light and compact phone made by plastic back and frame.Display : 90 Hz is a sweet spot. Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.",29 March 2022

1033,4.0,A good phone to buy,"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.",3 March 2022

But with moderate or more use it lasts about 10-12 hrs which is good enough.•camera - not quite great that is you wont expect this from oneplus but in this range I'll give it a solid 3/5.• audio, video, wireless connectivity all seemed very smooth.•Design-wise it's not exactly premium looking but not totally badRest will again review after a month.",6 June 2022

The looks are awesome but the plastic back panel disappointing it could be glass. The good thing is you get one plus stickers and a plastic back cover with damage protection (the design of the back cover in a way that it protects your mobile glass from the damage the corners are edgy) so you don't need to buy it with extra cost. Just go for it I bought it for 23999. Very smooth and slick handset.

1109,4.0,One Plus is Brand,I am writing this after one complete month of usgae of phone.The phone is a good midranger one if you get it under 20 K using the exchange offer and card one too but not worth it if you get it for 24 K .If you are going to invest 24 K then go for Realme GT Master Edition Or Redmi Note 11 Pro 5g Or Realme 9 Pro 5g Or Iqoo Phones or Samsung M series phones.The Pros AreThe Processor is very good in this range and have multibands 5g.It has a 90 HZ Amoled (Good) Display.The OS is very nice.The Battery 🔋 stays long and is accomplished by 65 watt charger which makes it much more valuable.It can have memory card as well have two sims which is amazing.ConsThe Camera 📸 is not up to the mark as one hopes one plus will give.It lacks the the one plus slider.Overall it's a good choice for 20 K.,28 March 2022

1115,4.0,Overall okay but it can't beat camera quality of oppo,"Biggest mistake was to order at Amazon. I myself went at Amazon depot to receive it because delivery boy was not ready to come at 6 pm. Return is most complicated in Amazon. They fixed appointment with technician yesterday and there is no call till now. Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo..",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 19 July 2022

1141,5.0,Great value phone for the price!,"I made the switch from my Samsung M51 to the Nord CE 2. I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. I read quite a lot of reviews as well. Here's my experience so far:1. I am not a gamer and do not use phones for gaming.2. I am not a photographer and am quite happy with simple photos. I don't care about contrast or saturation.3. I use my phone mainly for banking, messaging, browsing and calls.Switching from the Samsung M51, the Nord CE 2 feels a lot smoother. I can't tell much of a difference in the display between the two. The outdoor brightness for the phone is decent. There is no bloatware installed on the phone which is fantastic (Samsung needs to learn from this!). Sure, there is no Android 12 out of the box but I don't miss it since I've never used it and Android 11 is perfectly fine. The phone will receive the Android 12 update but it might take time (I'm in no hurry). The camera is fine for my needs. It comes with a headphone jack and a charger. Charging is fast -- I went from 50% to 100% in under 25 minutes. I also like that the phone is slightly smaller than the M51 and fits well in my hand and pocket. I've not experienced any overheating issues.Overall, for the price (I got a great deal since I exchanged my phone), it's a great phone. Some people are expecting too much from this phone but if your needs are simple like mine, this is an excellent device.",2 May 2022

Blindly buy this product and enjoy the smooth and stylish Phone.",5 June 2022

1144,4.0,Affordable good quality.,"A big fan of 1+ phones n this is my fourth 1+ during last 6-7 years. Reason : Price competitive for the same specs of other Chinese competition makes. That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone. Better remove phone cover while playing games.",3 April 2022

Airtel 5G is connecting but performance not better than 4G, may be the 5G network is still evolving.UI is pathetic with lot of bugs especially notification related. Disabled notifs are still getting notified. Raised with Dev team, got a reply its a known issue and will be resolved in further software releases. Hope they resolve them.Camera was OK, couldnt understand that 64 MP wide mode, not much effective though.Nothing much to say about.",12 December 2022
1240,3.0,Its very delicate!!,"I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.😞 DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 April 2022

And the bug is so bad, that almost always, the power button has to be pressed for unlocking the phone and at times even then, the fingerprint sensor doesn't give prompt and so the pin has to be entered. Pathetic, I'd say.Worse still is, as understood from the OnePlus community website, the bug is known to the developers, but they've been unable to bring an resolution to this issue till now.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 22 April 2022

To be honest his was a good purchase. Mine didn't turn out as i had expected. Issues that I faced were and some are in ""are"" category1. At times heats up while charging2. Heated up while playing a game especially ""rocket league"". Had to uninstall it3. The pro game mode makes no difference, the frame rate doesn't appear and isn't 60fps (even if i load the 90fps from sys settings)4. At times the finger sensor doesn't show up and i have to do the unlocking using the pin code only.5. Sometimes when I open up a website and zoom in on any picture, then it becomes a task to zoom it out or sometimes even scrolling becomes a big no. And i have to reload the webpage to zoom out from it.6. Oh! Last but not the least, the macro camera is the worst, i love taking macro shots and when I saw its camera well you can guess how mad i would have gotten.Not to leave the pros though1.

1381,5.0,Absolutely Fantastic Phone,"Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 16 June 2022

I was considering yo buy iPhone SE but then I saw a OnePlus phone at 18,999 which was a bit odd to me. So I researched about the phone and turns out this is the best budget friendly phone you can buy!! Absolutely stunning camera, Oxygen OS optimises the apps to perfectly that background apps don't drain your battery. It charges fast and you can just charge it 30mins in the morning before you leave for college or work and it'd be at 100% . I'll be uploading a few pictures taken from this device just to show the camera's brilliance. At this price, I'd suggest that it's totally worth it to buy this OnePlus device and not go for other brands.",8 September 2022

1474,3.0,Recommended for Bug n spam free OS experience.,"Actually the rating is three and half stars. Since there's no provision for half star so I've rated it Three! Especially recommended to those who haven't experienced the OnePlus' Oxygen OS so far. For the uninitiated, Oxygen OS provides the bloatware-free OS. Closer to near stock Android.  No spammy notifications like Xiaomi or even Samsung nowadays. Mostly bug-free. The interface is neat.Battery is awesome. Easily lasts whole day with moderate to heavy usage.Camera is just above average.Display is great though it's LCD. Since it's LCD so obviously there's no in-screen fingerprint scanner. It's embedded with physical power button. So people looking for in-screen fingerprint scanner might feel disappointed.Sometimes screen remains dark and unresponsive despite ringing which can be resolved with new S/W patch provided OP deems it worthy to address. Obviously it can't be compared with it's more expensive cousins but overall a nice big phone and the best in this price range. Definitely worth a try, especially if you haven't used Oxygen. For the rest, be adventurous, try something new if you can, otherwise it's always a safe bet.",24 June 2022

The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn’t take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 17 May 2022

Got two security patch updates too in a week which is really a great thing.The camera is really good. The phone looks premium and is lightweight and slim. It feels good in hand.Even though the speaker is mono firing speaker and not stereo speakers, it really is very loud. The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter.

Camera is decent as well, not the best of course but does the job tbh. Rest all features are good and one won't be dissatisfied. I'm super angry with Amazon's exchange service. I had requested an exchange for my old samsung device. I had an 4400 off the purchase price. But the delivery agent rejected the phone exchange. Phone is still working fine, it just had some scratch on the back due to wear and tear which is normal. But it was rejected and I had to pay the difference. Worst exchange service ever.

Battery lasts for a day with moderate to high usage. Could have been better if it's amoled and stereo speaker support. Feels like a realme phone with oxygen OS inside. Some phones in similar category has led and stereo. So those looks for budget friendly 1+ branded phone, go for it. Others think twice. I like my purchase and hope you all too..",6 May 2022

 Im writing this review after using the mobile for one month . The purpose of writing the review is to help the ppl who are planning to buy this phone. Even i do read read the reviews before purchasing any product online. if the review is honest it helps customers to take decision. If we talk about phone...the phone is very average. its design is very catchy but performance is very average. Battery of of phone drains very fast. Theres some heating issues issues in the phone . The phone hangs most of the times. The fingerprint sensor lags. There are lots of bugs in the phone. one of the biggest issue is after disconnecting the call..the call connect logo remains on ghe home screen.",24 August 2022

That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good. See attached photo taken from 5 th floor.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Netflix. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.Best of luck Chinese company... Till the time India doesn't develop its own effective mobile, keep earning.

1865,5.0,I don't see anything wrong with it. It's just a good phone. Delivery was shite though!,"This was my first phone above 20k, and tbh, it's not bad. I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too.",6 April 2022

1911,5.0,Best budget phone at this price!!!!,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 14 March 2022

Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12.

Yet, it managed to go below those minimum expectations as well. The camera is way below the quality of redmi note 11 (my previous phone) and you can't even install gcam as it's mediatek processor in Nord ce 2.Battery: Charges fast and discharges quickly as well. I can give 3/5 rating as it charges under 30 minutes by compensating the average battery backup.Display: 3/5 ratingIt doesn't seem like a high quality display. I think redmi note 11's (my previous phone) amoled display is better and brighter than this. But, It is an amoled display after all, you can expect good contrast, punchy colours in Nord ce 2 as well.Performance: 4/5 ratingNo lag, No heat, Works very well in day to day tasks.

I agree it's a low and budget phone but still had better expectations.Pros: great feel in hand looks premium, Great battery and charging is like awesome. Sound is loud and brightness is also good. Videos look awesome. Touch is great, processor is 👌🏻Cons: not a gaming phone you'll be disappointed with that. Camera isn't that good at all. Body is plastic, speaker location makes it not audible with texting. Video get stuck and security and update patch is still not given.If you want to buy a phone for good use and want to use it for a long time. This is okay.

2208,2.0,Bad product. Has heating issues,"I have ordered this item after doing lot of research for a good phone within my 25k budget. I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",28 May 2022

2337,1.0,Absolutely Waste of Money!,"If you're thinking about buying this phone, don't!.Firstly coming down to camera: The camera quality is pathetic, my old phone with much less price than this takes better photographs and videos.This phone captures no details still generates huge size photo for nothing but taking up space. Zoom level is only 6x.Video lags too much while recording and playing, the microphone levels are so unadjusted.If you were thinking of buying this for camera, just back off and get something else.Now coming to the networks, this phone has a lot of problems with it. Networks keeps dropping in between, you won't even know if you miss any important call or communication because of this.I thought this is only limited to my set, but after seeing the reviews seems like this device model has this problem.Once you restart phone, it works for some time but again the issue starts to happen. Did I spent my money to keep restarting this stupid thing?OnePlus has really really lost it's value. Horrible rebranding.This is my first and last purchase of OnePlus mobile.

In my previous phone, the images were stored in 100-400 kb, but one plus is taking 1.4 - 2 MB for a single image which is toooo much.",6 March 2022

Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8.",26 February 2022

Not satisfied with the support and what if my cam shows up same issue. I feel replacement/refund should be done, as this will not be possible after 2/3 days for my order.",12 May 2022

2971,2.0,Not a value for money item,"Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.And I initially noticed some heating issue on the screen side.One advantage is that, the weight is less.

On 19th March 2023 I found that this phone has a functionality where upon heating of the phone, the phone disables mobile hotspot and all apps and asks us to wait till it cools. We know that this a budget phone and thus heating will be a common issue.2) the fingerprint scanner works only in certain angles of your finger(like the way you hold guitar strings). The scanner is highly ergonomically uncomfortable and vibrates everytime you slide your phone into your pocket.Being a budget phone I was okay to forgive #2 but #1 is a killing blunder for me.The designer of this phone deserves a Raspberry award.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 19 March 2023

 This is the worst experience for me in 30 yrs, i sold out my new mobile in just 18 days & made loss of 12k cz it was not in working condition many times, network issue after ever few hours, every time I had to reboot to work my mobile. No network catching after every few hours & you remain unknown of that..!!!!! So you miss important calls..!!! Every time mobile gets hang & screen automatically gets on & off, no function & unlock w can be done after that.Sound quality was very very bad in speaker & earpiece, also next person was not able to hear clear voice.I was out of station when received mobile online, opened box exactly after return policy day expire, ie. exactly on 7th day of receiving mobile parcel.

This is missing feature OR you can say a major drawback!Conclusion-Only one plus premium phones which are in range 30k+ are worth buying otherwise this is just another oppo/ ordinary phone.

I spend my all savings and also I took help from my parents in buying this phone and ended up in buying the worst phone ever. Issue started just after the return period expired. Network suddenly goes off. And when I'm on call, the call hangs off because of the network. I went to the service centre even though the issue remained unsolved. Since I can't afford the expense of buying another phone, I'm using it with teared eyes...I was very happy after buying this phone but now I'm crying because of this phone... I'll never ever trust OnePlus again and I'll recommend everyone who are going to buy this phone that please go for another phone than to buy this crap...",18 February 2023

MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?10..No stereo speakerFew pros :-Look wise its best.. Display is top notch..

Even if we lock the phone while in a call, the display turns on automatically with every small movement and will start dialling on it own which will make the listener uncomfortable (listening to the continuous tap on keys).

4348,1.0,The phone has a software issue with regards to the camera.,"This is my first Oneplus purchase, and I got it for my mother. We have come from using Moto and Lenovo phones, which were decent and got the job done. If not for the damage in one of them, I would have continued with them.I had heard a lot of good this about Oneplus from my friends and family and was excited to get the phone.But on using the phone for a few days, I was left unsatisfied with the cameras. I personally use the Pixel 4a, and despite the pixel having a lesser resolution camera, it outshines the CE2. I was ok with that, because well, pixel is pixel. But, then the most bizarre thing happened. One fine day, the camera app stopped working completely (crashes at launch). Tried all the basic trouble shooting steps recommended by Oneplus, but nothing worked. The flashlight toggle in the notification shade was also greyed out with the message 'camera in use', even after resetting the device completely.At this point, I booked a service request with the care app and sent it for repair. Got the device back in a week, working properly. But to my surprise, after a week of use, the same problem has happened again.I am extremely disappointed and frustrated at this point. This was not expected from Oneplus as a brand. This has left an awfully bad first impression on me and I would not recommend this phone / brand to anyone, based on this experience.",1 August 2022

4952,1.0,WORST PHONE EVER,"I consider this as the worst phone that i ever bought, just after one and half month of use the display of the phone went BLANK ( showing nothing just like switched off display) without doing any physical damage. for customer service i had to take the phone to BANGALORE as people in nearby service center said its not possible for them to service this problem and it is done in bangalore only. In bangalore these service center people initially tried blame me that i mast have done some physical damage even after explaining them that  i havent done anything. however they agreed to repair the phone they said display of the phone has to be replaced and it would take 7 days (on 24/6/2022).  4 days later they called and said they have replaced the phone with new display but still its not working and need to run the software check and need my permission to erase all my data ( that means it is not the display problem in the first place and they were blaming me, instead they should have done the software check first) . its been a week since i havent heard from them neither they are picking my call ( worst customer service) .i demand replacement with the new phone.beware before buying this phone.... its not what you think... if something goes wrong you will not get the reliable customer service/response.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 5 July 2022

4990,2.0,OnePlus on a budget is not really a good bet.,"I have previously used a realmeX2 to set a competitive benchmark. I usually have 2 expectations from my phone, great display and camera. Really didn't expect the absence of an AMOLED display would be this critical, but I've realised it is after using this phone. The display is decent at best. When it comes to camera, the low light performance is really bad and the photos seem grainy if the place is not well lit. Also the absence of wide angle is disheartening.It's not all bad though, the skin is really clean and the phone seems to sail through applications. Go for a better phone if camera is what you want.",Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 13 July 2022
